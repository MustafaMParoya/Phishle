    <h1>What is Phishing</h1>
    <p>Phishing is a scam that targets users typically in the form of an email that seems to be from a trusted source(ie. a Bank, an ISP, or a online shopping company). They usually try to get the user to input important personal information such as driver license information, bank account information, or social security number, so that they can steal the user's money or identity.</p>
