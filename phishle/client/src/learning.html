    <h1>What is Phishing?</h1>
    <p>Phishing is a cybercrime tactic employed by individuals or groups to
        trick users into exposing sensitive information such as passwords, bank accounts, social security numbers,
        credit card numbers,
        or personal identification details. Typically initiated via email, phishing attempts often
        impersonate entities like banks, online retailers, or government agencies.
        These fraudulent messages appear legitimate and prompt recipients to click on links, download attachments,
        or enter confidential data on fake websites designed to resemble real ones. Once obtained,
        the stolen information can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious purposes.
        Phishing attacks exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technical weaknesses, making awareness and
        caution essential defenses against falling victim to such scams..</p>
