    <h1>What is Phishing</h1>
    <p>Phishing is a scam that targets users typically in the form of an email that seems to be from a
        trusted source (i.e., a bank, an ISP, or an online shopping company). They usually try to get the
        user to input important personal information such as driver's license information, bank account
        information, or social security number, so that they can get access to the user's money or online accounts.</p>

    <h2>Tips For How to Avoid and Defend Yourself from Phishing Scams</h2>
